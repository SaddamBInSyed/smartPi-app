#  Home
In the Home Activity you can observe some information about yourself and of your house, in particular the currently weather forecast based on the location and the rooms that are available to compute operations; if you do not find a room, you can easly add a new one.
Moreover, on the top in the right corner we have a button about your [profile](https://sergiopicca.github.io/smartPi-app/pages/ui-profile-recap.html) where you can logout or if you want to change your profile picture, you can do it.
Notice that in the bottom you can go throught the [chat](https://sergiopicca.github.io/smartPi-app/pages/ui-chat.html) or the [edit](https://sergiopicca.github.io/smartPi-app/pages/ui-edit.html) tabs.
