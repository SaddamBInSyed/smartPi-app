#  *Login and registration*

## Login
The Login gives you three different mode to access in our app:
- [*Email and password*](#email)
- [*Google*](#google)
- [*Facebook*](#facebook)

### [Email and password](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/android/password-auth)
It is the classic method: once you are registered, you put in the fields your email and password inserted during the registration step.

### [Google](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/android/google-signin)
If you have a Google account and you do not want to have some troubles with remembering your password, it will be the authentication that you need: pressing the Google button you automatically are signed up and then loged in our app.

### [Facebook](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/android/facebook-login)
In the same way of Google authentication, the Facebook button does the same operation but it uses your Facebook account.

## Registration
More in depth, let us see the phase of registration.
First of all, the user has to fill the form with his email and a password and once he has completed it, the next step is to create an house or join an existing house.
- *New house*: this option is suggested when you are new to this system and you are the owner of you house and you want to set up your videosurveillance system. The form to complete provides information about your house (address, geolocalization and eventually the telephone number) in order to recognize it. At the end, you are redirected to the Home Activity in your house.
- *Existing house*: if you are new and someone has suggested to use this app, probabily he will provide also a code of his house: the only thing that you need is to insert it in the field and then you will be redirected to the Home Activity.

## What if I lose my password?
If you are registered with your email and you forget your password, you can reset it in order to log in again without any problems.
