#  Edit
In this tab, you can see in which houses are you inside and in particular you can modify them editing the name of the house or add/change the telephone number.
Additionally, you can get a look to the images that are stored in the database according to the camera configured.

In our mind, the idea is to extend this section adding some features like the elimination of an house or the possibility to have more then two houses.
This operetation consider also the opportunity to choose the house in which you can check the status or chat with the components of that house.
So in conclusion, this tab is going to be the center manager of you houses. As soon as possible, new updates are uploaded here. Stay tuned!
