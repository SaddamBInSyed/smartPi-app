#  Yoshi, you have a new message!

One the features of our application was to integrate a little chat allowing the owner of the house and his guests, we like to call it his **family**, to communicate in order to leave some simple message, maybe also regarding the house, such as "Hi guys, remember that the video surveillance system is active!".
