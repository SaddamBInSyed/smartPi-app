# Alexa skill

An alexa skill permits to the user to control the camera and the position of the servo motor using his voice.

The skill allows to:

* Enable/disable the motion detection
* Enable/disable the face recognotion
* Set the position of the servo motor from -90 to 90 degree
* Request to take a photo

Unfortunately the developed skill (you can find the code in our GitHub repository) is in italian (to permits at my parents to use it).

Check the [Alexa Developer console](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask?&) to know more about developing an Alexa skill.
