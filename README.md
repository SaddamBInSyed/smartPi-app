# SmartPi

This project has been developed by Gianluca Tasciotti, Sergio Picca, and Stefano Milani. We are three students of the Master in Engineering of Computer Science at Sapienza Univesity of Rome.

We developed a video surveillance system based on a Raspberry Pi that controls a PiCamera and a servo motor. The Android application offers the possibility to control the device.
