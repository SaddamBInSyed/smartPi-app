The idea
==================
SmartPi is an Android smart surveillance application that we built as a University project for the *Mobile application and cloud computing course* in *Sapienza University of Rome*. The application connects to a remote controllable PiCamera on a Raspberry Pi 3, supporting both **motion detection** and **face recognition** that we can switch on by using the app.
