#  The idea

SmartPi is an Android smart surveillance application that we built as a University project for the *Mobile application and cloud computing course* in *Sapienza University of Rome*. The application connects to a remote controllable PiCamera on a Raspberry Pi 3, supporting both **motion detection** and **face recognition** that we can switch on by using the app.

To learn more about us, the aim of this project and to take a look of our LinkedIn profiles you can go to the [about page](https://sergiopicca.github.io/smartPi-app/pages/about.html). If you want to look the code in more detail you can access to the official [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sergiopicca/smartPi-app/) of this project.
